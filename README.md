## Scripting Guide

Scripting in Roblox can be fun and rewarding. Here are some tips to get you started:

### Basic Lua Concepts

- **Variables**: Store data using variables. For example:
  ```lua
  local playerName = "Player1"
  ```
  
- **Functions**: Create reusable code blocks. For example:
  ```lua
  function greetPlayer(name)
      print("Hello, " .. name)
  end
  ```

- **Loops**: Repeat actions with loops. For example:
  ```lua
  for i = 1, 10 do
      print(i)
  end
  ```

### Advanced Scripting

As you get comfortable with Lua, you can explore more advanced concepts:

- **Tables**: Use tables to store collections of data.
- **Events**: Respond to game events with event listeners.
- **API Calls**: Interact with Roblox's API for advanced functionality.
